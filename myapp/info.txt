=> View :-

- By using select_related('design') in your Python code, you are telling Django to grab the Design details and the Moodboard link in one single "trip" to the database.


=> Template :-

- In Django, {% block content %} and {% endblock %} are the keys to Template Inheritance.

- The {% extends %} tag must be at the very top because of how Django’s template engine "compiles" HTML.

- Just because you imported a library in one Python file doesn't mean it’s automatically available in a second file you’ve connected to it.

- You must "import" (load) the static toolset into every specific file that needs to use the {% load static %} tag

- The compiler scans parent.html line by line. Every time it sees a {% block NAME %}, it marks that spot in its memory as a "Variable Slot."

It says: "I have a slot here called 'content'. If the child file gives me something for 'content', I will put it here. If not, I'll use whatever (if anything) is inside the block in this parent file."
